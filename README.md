<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This challenge I created a project that uses Github API as a prove of concept to an fullstack-developer opportunity, I used fastify to manage the routes and the backend stuffs and in frontend I used react, typescript and tailwindcss.

Since it's an opportunity I really want, I used TanStack Query considering that it is the powerful asynchronous state management and data fetching library.
